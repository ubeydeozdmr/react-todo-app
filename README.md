# react-todo-app

## IMPORTANT

- The preview of this project is almost exactly the same as [vue-todo-app](https://github.com/ubeydeozdmr/vue-todo-app).

- This project is the to-do application I made with Vue.js below, made with React instead of Vue.js.

- The information you will read from the Crema To-Do title below belongs to the vue-todo-app application. (Except for Development for React To-Do App section)

## Crema To-Do

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c77de7fb-32f0-462b-a8f4-f915b69861d5/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/crematodo/deploys)

A simple to-do app built using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com).

In this to-do app, you can add new todos, edit them or delete them.

## What's new in v1.3?

- Now, you can input your first name to show up top of the page (Instead of Crema To-Do title).

  - To activate this feature, go to Preferences > First name.

- Search todo feature added (Now, you can input keywords to find todo which you want)

  - If you don't want a search bar top of todolist, you can hide search bar from preferences ("Hide search bar" feature added)

- Show completed todos feature added

  - Hide completed todos feature (boolean) removed; instead, added three option called "Show all todos", "Show active todos" and "Show completed todos".
